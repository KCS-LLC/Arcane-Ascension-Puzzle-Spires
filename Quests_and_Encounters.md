# Quests, Events, & Encounters

This document provides the blueprint for the narrative and dynamic content. It is divided into two main categories: rare, high-impact **Spire Encounters** and frequent, narrative-driven **Manor Events**.

---

## 1. The Quest System

(This section remains largely the same, defining Main Story, House, and Critical Quests.)

---

## 2. Spire Encounters

Encounters found within the spire's "?" rooms are **intentionally rare**. Their purpose is to break up the core gameplay of combat and exploration with unique, high-impact events, not to be a constant occurrence.

*   **Base Rarity:** The chance of a "?" room containing a special encounter is low.
*   **Increasing Odds:** The probability of finding a Spire Encounter can be increased through:
    *   **Heir Traits:** Certain traits (e.g., "Curious," "Destined") may increase the chance of finding encounters.
    *   **Generational Knowledge:** Research on the "Path of Fortune" or similar trees can permanently boost the encounter rate.
    *   **Event Triggers:** A specific House Quest or Manor Event might temporarily guarantee an encounter on the next run.

### Encounter Categories (Spire)
*   **Mini-Puzzle:** A small, self-contained challenge.
*   **Unique Combat:** A fight with a special modifier or objective.
*   **Special Merchant:** A rare vendor with a unique, often high-risk, proposition.
*   **Narrative Choice:** A text-based scenario where the player makes a decision with immediate consequences for the current run.

## 3. Manor Events

While the heir is at the Manor between spire runs, time passes, and events will occur frequently. These events are the primary source of narrative, character development for the House, and risk/reward decision-making outside of combat.

*   **Frequency:** An event will trigger after every few "time units" spent in the Manor.
*   **Focus:** Manor events are primarily text-based scenarios that present the player with a choice.
*   **Core Systems:** These events are designed to directly interact with the **House Treasury**, **House Piety**, and **Generational Knowledge** systems.

### Event Categories (Manor)
*   **Financial Opportunity:** A local merchant offers a risky but profitable investment.
    *   **Choice:** Invest a large sum of Coins.
    *   **Outcome:** A random chance of a large profit or a significant loss after a set amount of time.
*   **Moral Dilemma:** A destitute family asks for aid, but your own House is struggling financially.
    *   **Choice A:** Offer a small donation. **Outcome:** Lose Coins, gain Piety.
    *   **Choice B:** Turn them away. **Outcome:** No change.
    *   **Choice C:** Offer them a high-interest loan. **Outcome:** Potential to gain Coins, lose Piety.
*   **House Management:** A trusted advisor suggests a new training regimen for the heirs.
    *   **Choice:** Spend Coins and Research Points to implement it.
    *   **Outcome:** Unlocks a new potential starting Trait for future heirs.
*   **Political Intrigue:** A rival House makes a veiled threat or a surprising offer of alliance.
    *   **Choice:** How to respond will affect inter-House relationships, potentially leading to future Critical Quests or unique opportunities.
