# The Judgement: Forging an Heir

This document details the Judgement, the critical introductory phase of gameplay that every new heir must undertake. The Judgement serves as a dynamic character creation process, a tutorial for core mechanics, and a narrative framing device for the beginning of each run.

## 1. Overview & Purpose

The Judgement is a trial undertaken within a simulated pocket dimension, overseen by a Visage (a powerful servant of the goddess). Its primary purpose is to assess an heir's aptitudes and grant them their starting Attunement, base stats, and equipment. Every Judgement is tailored to the individual, ensuring that each new heir's starting point is a direct result of the player's choices and performance.

The Judgement consists of three main phases:
1.  **The Visage's Assessment:** A series of questions to determine the heir's magical leanings and grant an Attunement.
2.  **The Puzzle Gauntlet:** A series of specialized match-3 challenges to establish the heir's starting base stats (Vigor, Speed, Wit).
3.  **The Trial Run:** A modified, short spire run to determine the heir's starting equipment and treasure.

## 2. Phase 1: The Visage's Assessment (Attunement Granting)

Upon starting, the heir is brought before a Visage. The Visage presents the player with a series of 3-5 situational or philosophical questions. Each question has multiple answers, and each answer is subtly aligned with the core principles of one or more of the Serpent Spire Attunements.

**Example Question:**

*A colossal beast blocks your path. Your goal is on the other side. You...*
    *   A) ...find a way around it, avoiding conflict entirely. (Leans towards **Shadow**, **Diviner**)
    *   B) ...stand your ground, preparing to defend against its inevitable attack. (Leans towards **Guardian**)
    *   C) ...empower yourself and your weapon for the coming clash. (Leans towards **Enchanter**)
    *   D) ...unleash a direct, overwhelming assault of pure power. (Leans towards **Elementalist**)

Based on the cumulative answers, the Visage will grant the heir the Attunement that best matches their chosen path. The Attunement is then affixed to a body location, chosen by the player from a thematically appropriate subset (e.g., an Elementalist might be offered a Hand or Heart location, while a Guardian might be offered a Leg or Body location).

## 3. Phase 2: The Puzzle Gauntlet (Base Stat Determination)

After receiving their Attunement, the heir is sent into a series of three puzzle rooms, each designed to test a core attribute. The heir's performance directly sets their starting Vigor, Speed, and Wit.

*   **The Trial of Vigor:**
    *   **Objective:** Survive for a set number of turns against an unending wave of spawning Skull gems.
    *   **Mechanic:** The board is smaller, and the focus is on defensive matching and survival.
    *   **Outcome:** The heir's starting **Vigor** is determined by the percentage of health they have remaining at the end of the trial.

*   **The Trial of Speed:**
    *   **Objective:** Score as many points as possible within a strict turn limit.
    *   **Mechanic:** The board is filled with high-value gems, and the focus is on creating large cascades and special gems quickly.
    *   **Outcome:** The heir's starting **Speed** is determined by their final score.

*   **The Trial of Wit:**
    *   **Objective:** Solve a complex board puzzle.
    *   **Mechanic:** The board is in a pre-set, challenging state (e.g., many locked gems, a specific pattern that must be cleared). The goal is to solve the puzzle in as few moves as possible.
    *   **Outcome:** The heir's starting **Wit** is determined by how efficiently they solve the puzzle, with fewer moves resulting in a higher stat.

## 4. Phase 3: The Trial Run (Starting Equipment)

The final phase is a short, curated run through a simulated "Floor 0" of the spire. This serves as a tutorial for combat and exploration.

*   **Gameplay:** The heir will face a few encounters with basic (Quartz-rank) monsters, find one or two common treasures, and face a very weak mini-guardian at the end.
*   **Outcome:** All currency, items, and equipment gathered during this Trial Run become the heir's starting inventory. This means a player who performs well might start with a slight advantage in gear.

Upon completion of the Trial Run, the Judgement is complete. A summary screen displays the granted Attunement, the final base stats, and the starting inventory. The heir is then transported to the Manor to prepare for their first real journey into the Puzzle Spires.
