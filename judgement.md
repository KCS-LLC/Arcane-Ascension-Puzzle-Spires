# The Judgement: Forging an Heir

This document details the Judgement, the critical introductory phase of gameplay that every new heir must undertake. The Judgement serves as a dynamic character creation process, a tutorial for core mechanics, and a narrative framing device for the beginning of each run.

## 1. Overview & Purpose

The Judgement is a trial undertaken within a simulated pocket dimension, overseen by a Visage (a powerful servant of the goddess). Its primary purpose is to assess an heir's aptitudes and grant them their starting Attunement, base stats, and equipment. Every Judgement is tailored to the individual, ensuring that each new heir's starting point is a direct result of the player's choices and performance.

The Judgement consists of three main phases:
1.  **The Visage's Assessment:** A series of questions to determine the heir's magical leanings and grant an Attunement.
2.  **The Puzzle Gauntlet:** A series of specialized match-3 challenges to establish the heir's starting base stats (Vigor, Speed, Wit).
3.  **The Trial Run:** A modified, short spire run to determine the heir's starting equipment and treasure.

## 2. Phase 1: The Visage's Assessment (Attunement Granting)

Upon starting, the heir is brought before a Visage. Instead of questions, the heir's magical and tactical aptitudes are tested directly through a series of match-3 trials. The Visage observes the heir's performance to grant an Attunement that reflects their innate problem-solving style and magical affinity. This assessment is a two-stage process: The Tactical Aptitude Gauntlet and the Mana Affinity Trial.

### **Stage 1: The Tactical Aptitude Gauntlet**

The heir is presented with three specialized mini-puzzles on small, pre-designed boards. These are presented in a random order to ensure each Judgement feels unique. The goal is not just to complete them, but to do so as efficiently as possible. The Visage grades the heir's performance on each, establishing a "tactical leaning."

*   **The Trial of Power:**
    *   **Objective:** Deal as much damage as possible within a strict 3-move limit.
    *   **Board State:** Densely populated with Skull and aggressive mana gems (e.g., Fire, Umbral).
    *   **Assesses:** A preference for direct, offensive action. Strong performance suggests an inclination towards Attunements like **Elementalist** or **Shadow**.

*   **The Trial of Haste:**
    *   **Objective:** Score as many points as possible within a strict turn limit.
    *   **Mechanic:** The board is filled with high-value gems, and the focus is on creating large cascades and special gems quickly.
    *   **Assesses:** A preference for speed and efficiency. Strong performance suggests an inclination towards Attunements with a high speed or wit component.

*   **The Trial of Control:**
    *   **Objective:** Create a specific number of special tiles (e.g., 4-matches, T-matches) in as few moves as possible.
    *   **Board State:** No immediate threats, but strategically arranged to reward careful planning and setup.
    *   **Assesses:** A preference for board manipulation and long-term strategy. Strong performance points towards Attunements like **Shaper**, **Enchanter**, or **Diviner**.

### **Stage 2: The Mana Affinity Trial**

Based on the heir's performance in the gauntlet, they are presented with a final, longer trial. The board for this trial is dynamically populated with specific gem types tailored to their demonstrated tactical strengths, along with a significant number of **Treasure tiles**.

*   **How it Works:** The game populates the board with mana subtypes that correspond to the Attunements suggested by the heir's strongest performance in Stage 1.
    *   *Example:* An heir who excelled at the **Trial of Power** might find their board filled with Fire, Umbral, and Light mana gems. An heir who mastered the **Trial of Control** might see Earth, Transference, and Perception gems.
*   **Objective:** Score as many points as possible within a time or turn limit by matching any available tiles. This includes strategically matching and upgrading Treasure tiles.
*   **Final Assessment:** The Visage performs its final analysis based on the results of this trial:
    1.  **Tactical Confirmation:** The heir's overall score confirms or adjusts the initial tactical leaning.
    2.  **Affinity Pinpointing:** The game tracks which specific mana subtypes the heir matched most frequently, revealing their true magical affinity.
    3.  **Resourcefulness:** The total final value of all Treasure tiles matched and upgraded is recorded. This provides a direct measure of the heir's resourcefulness and opportunism.

Based on the combined results of both stages, the Visage grants the heir the Attunement that best fits their demonstrated abilities. The Attunement is then affixed to a body location chosen by the player from a thematically appropriate subset.

## 3. Phase 2: The Puzzle Gauntlet (Base Stat Determination)

After receiving their Attunement, the heir is sent into a series of three puzzle rooms, each designed to test a core attribute. The heir's performance directly sets their starting Vigor, Speed, and Wit. **Treasure tiles** are also present on these boards, and any value accrued contributes to the heir's starting equipment.

*   **The Trial of Vigor:**
    *   **Objective:** Survive for a set number of turns against an unending wave of spawning Skull gems.
    *   **Mechanic:** The board is smaller, and the focus is on defensive matching and survival.
    *   **Outcome:** The heir's starting **Vigor** is determined by the percentage of health they have remaining at the end of the trial.

*   **The Trial of Speed:**
    *   **Objective:** Score as many points as possible within a strict turn limit.
    *   **Mechanic:** The board is filled with high-value gems, and the focus is on creating large cascades and special gems quickly.
    *   **Outcome:** The heir's starting **Speed** is determined by their final score.

*   **The Trial of Wit:**
    *   **Objective:** Solve a complex board puzzle.
    *   **Mechanic:** The board is in a pre-set, challenging state (e.g., many locked gems, a specific pattern that must be cleared). The goal is to solve the puzzle in as few moves as possible.
    *   **Outcome:** The heir's starting **Wit** is determined by how efficiently they solve the puzzle, with fewer moves resulting in a higher stat.

## 4. Phase 3: The Trial Run (Starting Equipment)

Upon completion of the puzzle gauntlet, the total value of all Treasure collected during the Visage's Assessment is calculated. This value directly determines the quality and quantity of the heir's starting equipment, which is granted to them immediately.

The final phase is a short, curated run through a simulated "Floor 0" of the spire using this new gear. This serves as a tutorial for combat and exploration.

*   **Gameplay:** The heir will face a few encounters with basic (Quartz-rank) monsters, find one or two common treasures, and face a very weak mini-guardian at the end.
*   **Outcome:** All currency and additional items gathered *during this Trial Run* are added to the heir's starting inventory. This means a player who performs well in the initial trials (to get good gear) and in the trial run itself will start their first real journey into the spire with a significant advantage.

Upon completion of the Trial Run, the Judgement is complete. A summary screen displays the granted Attunement, the final base stats, and the complete starting inventory. The heir is then transported to the Manor to prepare for their first real journey into the Puzzle Spires.
