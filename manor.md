# The Manor & House Systems

This document details the mechanics of the Manor, the player's central hub, and the various meta-progression systems that define the House's legacy.

## 1. The Manor Hub

The Manor is the game's "home base" where all activity between spire runs takes place. It is a physical space that the player can upgrade and expand over generations.

### Key Locations & NPCs
*   **The Great Hall:** The central chamber where the player selects their next heir. Retired (surviving) family members may be present here, offering advice or training.
*   **The Treasury:** Where the House's permanent wealth (Coins) is stored and managed.
*   **The Vault:** A secure room for storing Heirloom items to be passed between generations.
*   **The Knowledge Tree:** Research Points can be spent on a branching skill tree, allowing the player to make strategic choices about which areas of advancement (e.g., magical prowess, physical resilience, economic advantage) to prioritize for their House's legacy.
*   **The Training Grounds:** Where heirs can receive instruction and where Classrooms are built.
*   **The Marketplace:** An area that initially houses a simple merchant but can be upgraded to attract specialized vendors.

## 2. Manor Upgrades

The primary form of meta-progression is upgrading the Manor itself. All upgrades are purchased from the House Treasury and are permanent.

### Upgrade Paths

| Upgrade | Tier 1 (Cost: Low) | Tier 2 (Cost: Medium) | Tier 3 (Cost: High) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Marketplace** | **Traveling Peddler:** Sells basic Quartz-rank items and potions. | **Established Shopkeeper:** Sells a wider range of Quartz & Carnelian items. Unlocks the ability to buy back items from the vault. | **Master Artisan:** Sells Sunstone-rank items and offers basic item enchanting services. |
| **Library** | **Study:** Unlocks the Research system, allowing passive generation of "Research Points". | **Expanded Library:** Increases Research Point generation. Unlocks 5 new spells to be found in the spire. | **Grand Athenaeum:** Maximizes Research Point generation. Unlocks the ability to research specific Attunement specializations. |
| **Training Grounds**| **Sparring Circle:** Allows heirs to train with family members for a small, temporary buff for their next run. | **Classroom:** Unlocks a new Serpent Spire Attunement to be available during the Judgement. (Can be built multiple times). | **Attunement Academy:** Reduces the cost of building new Classrooms. Grants all new heirs a small boost to their starting mana capacity. |
| **Vault** | **Reinforced Chest:** Provides 10 slots for storing Heirloom items. | **Secure Vault:** Expands storage to 25 slots. | **Arcane Repository:** Expands storage to 50 slots and makes all items stored within gain the "Heirloom" property faster. |

### 3. The House Treasury & Financial Obligations

The economic health of the House is a critical mechanic that creates urgency and risk.

*   **Income:** The House Treasury is funded exclusively by heirs successfully exiting the spire with their carried Coins.
*   **Expenses (Financial Obligations):** At regular intervals (e.g., every 5 "time units" spent in the Manor), a payment for taxes and upkeep is due. The amount due slowly increases as the Manor is upgraded.
*   **Financial Crisis & Game Over:** Failing to meet financial obligations will initially result in escalating penalties (e.g., temporary debuffs to heirs, reduced Manor services). However, persistent failure or reaching a critical debt threshold will ultimately lead to the **disbanding of the family and a game loss**.
*   **Mid-Game Financial Management:** Once the House is established (e.g., after a few generations or specific milestones), new options become available to manage financial crises:
    *   **Selling Assets:** Players can sell items from the Vault or even downgrade Manor facilities to raise emergency funds.
    *   **Taking Loans:** Loans can be taken from various factions, but come with interest and potential long-term consequences if not repaid.
    *   **Critical Quests:** Special, high-risk/high-reward quests may appear, offering a chance to earn a large sum of Coins quickly, but often at a significant cost or danger to the heir.

## 5. House Piety & Heir Traits

The quality of traits for new heirs is not tied to the House's wealth, but to its standing with the goddess, represented by a hidden **Piety** (or Karma) score. This score reflects the House's adherence to divine will and honorable conduct.

*   **Gaining Piety:** Piety is increased by:
    *   Successfully defeating Spire Guardians.
    *   Completing certain "honorable" random encounters or quests.
    *   Making selfless choices in narrative events.
    *   Donating a portion of spire earnings to a temple or charity (a potential Manor upgrade).
*   **Losing Piety:** Piety is decreased by:
    *   Failing critical quests.
    *   Making dishonorable or selfish choices in events.
    *   Taking on certain types of high-interest loans from unsavory factions.
*   **Effect on Heirs:**
    *   **High Piety:** Increases the probability of new heirs being generated with powerful positive traits.
    *   **Low Piety:** Increases the probability of new heirs being generated with significant negative traits.

This system ensures that a wealthy but dishonorable House may struggle with flawed heirs, while a poor but virtuous House can still be blessed with exceptional talent.
