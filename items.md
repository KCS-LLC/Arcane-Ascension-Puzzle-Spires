# Items, Equipment, and Treasures

This document details the system of items and equipment that players will find, use, and store. Items are a primary driver of an heir's power within a run and a key component of the House's long-term legacy.

---

## 1. Item Rarity & Power Level

All items are categorized by a power level, mirroring the Attunement ranking system. This rank determines the item's general power, the complexity of its enchantments, and its rarity.

*   **Quartz:** The most common items. Usually have a single, minor enchantment.
*   **Carnelian:** Uncommon items, often with one or two moderate enchantments.
*   **Sunstone:** Rare and powerful items, typically featuring a unique special property alongside significant stat bonuses.
*   **Citrine:** Legendary items. These are powerful artifacts with game-changing abilities. Many items from the books (e.g., Sacred Swords) would be Citrine or higher.
*   **Emerald:** The highest tier of legendary items, possessing immense power. These are exceedingly rare and are often rewards for defeating the most powerful Spire Guardians.
*   **Heirloom:** This is a special, independent designation. When an item is stored in the House Vault and used by multiple generations, it can become an Heirloom, gaining a slight bonus to its effectiveness.

## 2. Equipment

Equipment is worn by the heir to provide passive stats and abilities. It fits into specific slots, as defined in `player.md`.

### 2.1. Stat Affixes

Most equipment comes with randomly generated affixes that boost the heir's core stats:

*   **Vigor:** (e.g., "of Fortitude", "+5 Vigor")
*   **Speed:** (e.g., "of Alacrity", "+5 Speed")
*   **Wit:** (e.g., "of Cunning", "+5 Wit")
*   **Health:** (e.g., "of Health", "+20 Max HP")
*   **Mana Capacity:** (e.g., "of the Adept", "+15 Max Fire Mana")

### 2.2. Special Properties

Higher-ranked items often have unique properties drawn from the lore. These are what truly define a build.

**Example Equipment:**

*   **Name:** Boots of Superior Speed
*   **Slot:** Feet
*   **Rank:** Sunstone

    **Slot:** Weapon (Two-Handed)
    **Rank:** Citrine
    **Stats:** +15 Vigor, +10 Speed

## 3. Consumables

These are single-use items found within the spire. They are held in the heir's temporary inventory and are lost on death.

*   **Potions:** Provide immediate effects, like healing HP or restoring a specific type of mana.
*   **Mana Crystals:** Crushing one of these provides a large, immediate infusion of a specific mana type.
*   **Escape Bell:** A rare, single-use item. When used, it allows the heir to safely exit the spire from any floor, preserving all carried loot and transferring it to the House.
*   **Grimoires:** A book that, when read, permanently teaches the heir a new spell for the duration of the run.

## 4. Treasures

Treasures are special items that are not equipped but provide value. They are primarily used to be sold for a high price back at the Manor, contributing significantly to the House Treasury.

*   **Jaden Box:** A valuable puzzle box. A high 'Wit' stat might allow an heir to solve it mid-run for an immediate reward.
*   **Purestone:** A rare gem that can be sold for a large amount of Marks or sometimes used in special random encounters.
*   **Ancient Tomes:** While some are Grimoires, others are purely historical texts that can be returned to the Manor's Library to contribute to **Generational Knowledge**.
