# Attunements: Abilities and Mechanics

This document details the functionality of Attunements, the core magical classes in Arcane Ascension: The Puzzle Spires. For the initial base game, players will only have access to Attunements originating from the **Serpent Spire**.

## 1. General Attunement Mechanics

Attunements are granted during the Judgement and affix to a specific body location (Hand, Leg, Lungs, Heart, Mind), influencing their primary method of spell direction and mana regeneration. Each Attunement provides access to Grey Mana and initially two specific mana types, with a third (tertiary) type unlocking at the Citrine rank.

### 1.1. Attunement Ranks

Attunements progress through gemstone ranks, which determine their power level and unlock new abilities:

*   **Quartz:** Basic level. Provides initial mana access and abilities.
*   **Carnelian:** Unlocks the **Shroud** ability, a personal magical barrier.
*   **Sunstone:** Enhances existing abilities and may grant new, more potent spells.
*   **Citrine:** Unlocks the Attunement's tertiary mana type, significantly expanding spell options.
*   **Emerald:** Represents a mastery of the Attunement, granting powerful passive bonuses and ultimate abilities.

### 1.2. Mana Access and Conversion

Attuned individuals collect mana from the atmosphere in their marked body part. Mana can be converted between the types provided by the attunement, though this may incur a speed cost or be less efficient for non-primary types.

### 1.3. Attunement Specializations

Consistently using a specific mana type disproportionately can lead to an Attunement Specialization. This alters the attunement to favor future mana production of that type and may grant additional unique effects.
