# Audio Design Document

This document provides a high-level creative brief and a list of required assets for the game's audio. It is intended to guide a composer or sound designer in creating a cohesive and impactful soundscape that aligns with the game's magical, roguelike nature.

## 1. Overall Audio Direction & Philosophy

The audio should evoke a sense of wonder, danger, and strategic thought. The goal is to create a soundscape that is both magical and satisfyingly tactile.

*   **Music:** The score should be primarily orchestral and melodic, with magical and ethereal elements. It should be dynamic, shifting in intensity to match the player's current situation (e.g., calm exploration vs. intense boss battle).
*   **Sound Effects (SFX):** SFX should be crisp, clear, and provide immediate, satisfying feedback to the player. The puzzle board, in particular, should feel responsive and almost tangible through its sound design.

## 2. Soundtrack (Music) - Required Pieces

*   **Main Title Theme:** An inspiring and memorable theme that captures the spirit of legacy and adventure.
*   **Manor Hub Theme:** A calm, thoughtful, and slightly grand piece. It should feel like a safe, strategic space where the weight of the family's legacy is felt.
*   **Spire Exploration (Quartz Domain):** A quiet, mysterious, and slightly wondrous track for the early floors.
*   **Spire Exploration (Carnelian Domain):** The music becomes more tense and complex, introducing a greater sense of danger.
*   **Spire Exploration (Sunstone Domain):** The music is now more ominous and driving, reflecting the high stakes of the deeper floors.
*   **Standard Combat Theme:** An energetic, magical, and rhythmically engaging track for regular monster encounters. It should be exciting but not overly epic, to avoid fatigue.
*   **Spire Guardian Theme:** An epic, orchestral boss battle theme with a strong, memorable melody and a sense of immense scale and danger.
*   **Judgement Theme:** An ethereal and slightly tense piece for the Judgement sequence.
*   **Game Over Cue:** A short, somber musical piece that plays upon the loss of the House.
