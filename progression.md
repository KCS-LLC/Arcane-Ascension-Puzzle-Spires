# Heir Progression Mechanics

This document details the systems through which an individual heir grows in power during a single run within the spire. Progression is divided into three core pillars: the growth of Base Stats, the expansion of Mana Pools, and the advancement of Attunement Ranks.

## 1. Base Stat Progression (Vigor, Speed, & Wit)

An heir's core stats (Vigor, Speed, Wit) do not increase through combat or defeating monsters. Instead, they are improved through specific, significant events and discoveries within the spire. This makes each increase a valuable and deliberate achievement.

### Methods of Growth
*   **Quest & Event Rewards:** Certain random encounters, narrative events, or successfully completed quests may offer a permanent increase to a base stat as a reward. (e.g., "You drink from a mysterious spring, feeling invigorated. +1 Vigor.")
*   **Consumable Treasures:** Heirs may find rare, single-use items that grant a permanent stat increase.
    *   **Tome of Fortitude:** Grants +1 Vigor.
    *   **Elixir of Alacrity:** Grants +1 Speed.
    *   **Crystal of Insight:** Grants +1 Wit.

### Heirloom Stats (Legacy Mechanic)
Base stat increases earned by one heir can directly benefit the next generation.
*   **Passing the Torch:** For every **5 points** an heir gains in a base stat *above their starting value*, their direct successor in the lineage will begin their own journey with a **+1 bonus** to that same stat. This makes a successful, well-developed heir a massive asset for the future of the House.

## 2. Mana Pool Progression & Mana Scarring

An heir's mana pools are treated like muscles: they grow stronger with use but can be damaged by strain. This system encourages active spellcasting while adding a strategic layer of risk management.

### Growth Through Use
*   **Training the Pools:** Every time an heir casts a spell or uses an ability that costs a specific type of mana, they gain a small amount of "progress" toward expanding that mana pool. Over time, consistent use of Fire magic will gradually increase the heir's maximum Fire Mana capacity.

### Overuse and Its Consequences
Pushing one's magical limits is dangerous and has tangible consequences. "Overuse" is defined as attempting to cast a spell when the corresponding mana pool is critically low (e.g., below 10% capacity).

*   **Mana Burn (Temporary Damage):** The first few instances of overuse on a specific mana pool will result in a "Mana Burn." This is a temporary condition that reduces the maximum capacity of that mana pool for the next several encounters as it recovers.
*   **Mana Scarring (Permanent Damage):** Repeatedly causing Mana Burn to the same mana pool will result in **Mana Scarring**. This is a permanent reduction of that mana pool's maximum capacity *for the remainder of that heir's run*. A scarred mana pool also recovers from Mana Burn more slowly, making future overuse even more perilous.

## 3. Attunement Rank Progression

Attunement Rank is the primary measure of an heir's magical development and the main way new, powerful abilities are unlocked. An heir's rank is not tied to defeating enemies, but to their total mana capacity.

### Achieving New Ranks
*   **Total Mana Capacity:** An heir's Attunement Rank is determined by their total combined maximum mana across all their available pools. As their individual mana pools grow through use, this total value will cross specific thresholds, automatically advancing them to the next rank. Advancing in rank also improves the quality of gems on the board via the **Gem Aura System**.

### Rank Unlocks
*   **Quartz:** The starting rank for a new heir.
*   **Carnelian:** The first major milestone. Reaching this rank unlocks the heir's personal defensive **Shroud**.
*   **Sunstone:** The heir's control over their magic deepens, enhancing their existing spells and unlocking new, more powerful abilities.
*   **Citrine:** A significant leap in power. This rank unlocks the Attunement's **tertiary mana type**, granting access to a whole new set of spells and strategies.
*   **Emerald:** The pinnacle of an heir's in-run progression. Reaching this rank signifies mastery and unlocks an "ultimate" ability unique to their Attunement.
